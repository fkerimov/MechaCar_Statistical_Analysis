### Linear Regression to Predict MPG
#### Results
![linear_regression_results](images/mpg_linear_regression.png)

Assuming normal significance levels for variables (0.05), the results demonstrate that vehicle length, ground clearance, and intercept are statistically unlikely to produce random ammounts of variance to the mpg values in the dataset. 

The slope of the linear model is not zero because the coefficients are not equal to zero. 

While the R-Squared of the model suggests that 71% of predictions will be correct using this model, the statistical significance of the intercept is evidence that there is a lack of significant variables in the linear regression, i.e. the model is overfitted and fails to generalize and predict MechaCar prototypes correctly.
